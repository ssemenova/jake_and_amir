Amir coos like a pigeon. Jake cringes at his breath.] 
Jake doesn't respond.] 
Amir looks down. With a horrified look, he feels his lap.] 
Jake and Amir are working at their desks. Amir has fashioned a standing desk for himself by putting a small table on top of his regular desk. He also has a chocolate milkshake and a plate of nachos. He looks down at Jake.] 
Amir eats another nacho.] 
Amir begins making rhythmic hand motions. Jake waits for a while for him to keep talking.] 
Amir lays down on the floor.] 
Amir has fallen asleep on the floor.] 
Amir begins choking on his mouthful of nachos. Jake runs over to help him, and then reconsiders. He watches Amir struggle for air in his sleep, until Amir eventually lies still on the ground.] 
Amir suddenly coughs up his nachos all over Jake.] 
Jake scowls at Amir.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir does not have a computer. He tugs at his hoodie and wiggles his eyebrows at Jake.] 
Amir shakes his head.] 
A woman comes over briefly to hand Amir a manila envelope. Amir notices and begins laughing giddily.] 
Amir holds up a picture of himself dressed as an ear of corn with big cartoon gloves.] 
Jake raises his eyebrows. Amir grins silently at him.] 
Amir hands Jake the headshots. On top is one of Amir shirtless, wearing jeans low enough on his hips that his pubic hair is visible, albeit censored.] 
Amir is suddenly holding a colorful and simplistic painting with two stick figures.] 
Jake is wearing a sleeveless shirt and addressing the camera.] 
Amir dumps the bucket over Jake's head. Barely a small cup's worth of water comes out.] 
Jake shows Amir his penis below-screen, and Amir, who was initially hopping up and down with adrenaline, stops.] 
"ALSA.org" appears on screen. Jake gives a thumbs up.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir has his hands folded in front of his face to conceal his mouth.] 
Amir looks up and reveals that he has a dental grill.] 
hobbies. [Amir begins dancing in his seat.] You've had countless plastic surgeries-- stop dancing! [Amir stops.] None of it is ever to any avail. At the end of the day, you're still you... and you suck. 
Amir makes a mock-hurt expression.] 
Amir dabs his forehead, and salutes Jake sarcastically. Jake salutes him back. Amir pauses, and then begins crying.] 
Amir puts the sausage to its mouth, and it begins smoking and sizzling.] 
Jake is sitting on the couch. Amir comes in holding an iPad which has part of a broken display stand connected to it by a cable.] 
Amir begins shushing Jake.] 
Amir pulls out a pair of sunglasses and puts them on impossibly quickly.] 
Amir scratches Jake's face.] 
Jake is holding a cloth to his cheek.] 
Amir reaches out to scratch Jake, and Jake holds him back by the wrist.] 
Jake is holding a bloody cloth on each cheek.] 
Amir pulls out his penis and begins peeing all over himself.] 
Amir begins peeing everywhere again.] 
Jake is using the copier. Amir shows up.] 
Amir hoists himself up to sit on the glass, which immediately shatters under his weight.] 
Amir hits a button on the copier. It begins scanning, and Amir screams.] 
Jake tries to pull Amir. Amir pushes him away.] 
Amir presses some buttons, but the copying doesn't begin.] 
Amir begins bending forward slowly, moaning in pain.] 
Jake kneels down, surrounded by shards of bloodied glass, and loads the paper tray.] 
Amir has posted a copy on the bulletin board. He watches it intently to see if anybody will react. Pat walks by, looks at it, smirks, and continues on his way.] 
Amir, wearing a diaper, puts his leg up on the desk to strike a pose. There is a loud ripping sound.] 
Jake is at his desk. Amir comes in with flowers.] 
Jake chuckles.] 
Jake is at his desk. Amir is looking at him and slapping his fingers lazily against his other palm in a feeble attempt at clapping.] 
Amir holds up his iPhone, which has a card taped to it.] 
Amir begins crying, but immediately stops and squeals when he sees a mailman approaching with a package for him.] 
Amir opens the box.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir is playing a guitar.] 
Amir lets go of the guitar, and it falls hard to the floor. Jake cringes.] 
Jake doesn't respond.] 
Amir is raising his arms defensively.] 
Amir pulls out an apple pie, and pies himself in the face with it. It slides off gradually, and Amir looks disappointed in himself.] 
Jake gets up to leave. Amir sighs and eats bits of apple pie from the pan.] 
Jake and Amir are in a laundry room.] 
Amir is taking off his clothes.] 
Jake has begun the cycle. He and Amir stand in uncomfortable silence. Amir is naked.] 
Amir bangs his head against the washer over and over again.] 
Amir tickles Jake, who reflexively punches him in the face. Amir is out cold.] 
Amir pulls out his khakis, still with the stain on them.] 
Jake bends down and tickles Amir.] 
Amir giggles loudly.] 
Amir is still banging his head against the washer.] 
Amir is having a party in the laundry room with two women. Dance music is playing.] 
Jake is on the couch. Amir sits down, wearing a literal big foot costume.] 
Amir is dressed as a doctor in scrubs.] 
Amir is wearing an illusion costume of a baby in a mother's backpack carrier.] 
Amir is wearing another illusion costume, made to look like he is riding a turkey.] 
Amir is dressed in a Ghostbusters costume.] 
Amir is wearing a Maleficent gown costume.] 
Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume, and Jake is continuing the story.] 
Amir is dressed in a German costume with lederhosen. The liquid in his beer stein is a shade of yellow completely unlike beer.] 
Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume. Jake continues.] 
Amir is dressed as Leonidas.] 
Amir is dressed as a prisoner. He seems to have lost all energy.] 
Amir is in the Leonidas costume, and Jake is reeling from a kick in the chest.] 
Amir stands up again.] 
Amir, in the prisoner costume, continues his lament.] 
Amir is wearing an inflatable military costume.] 
Amir is wearing a bull rider illusion costume.] 
Amir is at a restaurant on a date. He and his date are sitting in uncomfortable silence. She brushes her hair away from her eyes, and in response, Amir makes a face as if he's straining to hear something she said.] 
Amir's date just shakes her head. They sit in silence for a while longer, and then she yawns.] 
The server pours Amir's date a glass of wine. As he stops pouring, Amir tips his hand back the way it was, filling the glass to the very top. Unable to pick it up without spilling it, Amir's date leans in to sip from it.] 
She grabs the cash and begins counting.] 
Amir's date leaves with the money.] 
Cut to black.] 
The rest of Amir's night is presented in a melancholy montage. Amir walks home, twitching with frustration. For lack of any emotional outlet, Amir lunges at a homeless man to try and make him flinch. The man lunges back, growling. Amir screams and runs away.] 
Amir enters his dark apartment and locks the door. He kicks one shoe off and tosses it into the corner, then flops down on his bed. He kicks off his other shoe, and it nearly hits him in the face. By his bedside table, we see that Amir has several pictures of Jake.] 
Amir unbuckles his belt and puts his hand in his pants. He masturbates while staring listlessly at the ceiling of his apartment.] 
Amir opens a packet of barbecue sauce and puts it on some chicken nuggets for himself.] 
Amir stares into the mirror, holding a toothbrush with toothpaste on it, and contemplates brushing his teeth. He shakes his head, and puts the toothbrush back down, throwing the toothpaste tube onto the sink counter with it.] 
Amir lies in bed, still numb. A framed picture of him and Jake sits in the background on his bedside table. Amir quietly begins crying.] 
Amir comes in to the office the next day, and sits down in the chair in solemn silence. Jake stares at him, waiting for something.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir is doing something on his laptop.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir has two black eyes, a large head bandage, a neck brace, and a full body cast. He is sitting in a wheelchair.] 
Amir leans over awkwardly and tries to maneuver his mouth to a danish that he has on a plate beside his computer.] 
Amir leans down again, grabs a bowl of cereal by biting the lip of the bowl, and sits up. Milk and cereal pour all over him.] 
Amir bites the lip of his coffee cup and tips it all over himself.] 
Amir starts trying to scoot in his wheelchair.] 
Amir scoots too hard and falls to the floor.] 
Amir is at his desk, and has Jake on video chat on his computer.] 
Throughout Amir's entire story, Jake has been ignoring him, occupying himself instead by texting, peeling a sticker off of a thermos, and even leaving to get chips at one point. Until the present moment, Amir has been too immersed in his own story to notice.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir is in a hazmat suit, with his gas mask pulled up above his face. He's wearing latex gloves, which he did not put on carefully enough to get his fingers in properly.] 
Jake doesn't react. Amir cups his hands around his mouth and repeats himself at full volume.] 
Nobody reacts.] 
Many people raise their hand.] 
Amir vomits.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir has headphones on. He gasps and grabs his chest, and then turns his attention to Jake and takes off his headphones.] 
Amir aggressively shushes Jake. As Amir talks, Jake mouths "Are you kidding me?"] 
Jake clicks, and Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" plays from his computer. Amir dances to the music.] 
Jake is sitting on the couch. After a few seconds, he seems to notice the viewer, curiously narrowing his eyes directly at the camera. Amir comes in and sits beside Jake, distracting him.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir holds up a scroll.] 
Jake begins throwing things from his desk at Amir. Amir uses the scroll to deflect them as he unrolls it.] 
Jake is speechless.] 
Amir quietly turns his attention to the scroll.] 
Amir chuckles.] 
Amir makes the motion a few more times. It looks progressively less like jumping.] 
Jake throws a pencil at Amir. Amir doesn't deflect it. The pencil stabs him in the throat and stays there.] 
Amir begins rolling up the scroll very slowly and calmly. Jake watches in bewilderment.] 
Jake and Amir are at their desks. Jake has just finished eating a banana. Amir is holding a compost bin under his arm. As Jake goes to throw away the peel, Amir stops him.] 
Amir mock-cries as Jake talks.] 
Amir pauses, clearly taken aback. After struggling mentally for a while, he answers.] 
Amir smiles quickly.] 
Amir is gnawing on an acorn.] 
Jake does an internet search. Amir watches expectantly.] 
Jake stands up and does the crotch chop taunt.] 
Amir nods.] 
Jake jumps, and shakes in fear.] 
Amir hands the compost bin over to Murph, who takes out a piece of moldy bread.] 
Murph forces the bread past Jake's hand and into his mouth.] 
The episode begins with a tracking shot through the office, where all of the employees are trying to work in spite of a loud argument taking place between Jake and Amir, who are still off-screen.] 
The tracking shot ends, and Amir is revealed to be wearing a baggy silver sweat suit.] 
Jake and Amir are sitting in Sam's office.] 
The episode begins at the end of the previous one, with Ben Schwartz bringing Jake and Amir into his house.] 
We see that Ben has many roommates that look exactly like him, accounting for all of what were assumed to be his previous appearances. The doctor and the priest are sitting at the table, and Scalbylausus Jim the H.R. guy, Sulu Candles the usher, and Charles Crooshtoost the milkman are in the kitchen. Amir Blumenfeld the dating coach scoots by on an office chair.] 
In the living room, the office painter, Cherry Dude the real estate agent, and the couples therapist are sitting on the couch. Jope the private eye is crouching behind them.] 
Jake shakes his head in disbelief.] 
Ben gestures at Amir excitedly.] 
The couples therapist begins doing his shrill seal laugh.] 
Jope chloroforms the couples therapist.] 
The office painter says something, but the cigarette in his mouth makes it unintelligible. Jope puts the couples therapist's hand in his pants while he's out.] 
The office painter repeats himself.] 
JAKE [to Ben, who looks like he is judging Jake] Don't do that. That's the first time he said it that way. 
Stanley, who is on the stairs, throws a net at Jake.] 
Carrot Slat comes through the door from another room.] 
As Jake and Ben argue, Carrot Slat is pulled back through the door. Stepping out in his place is the interrogator from Interrogator Part 2, who was apparently a different person the whole time.] 
The interrogator punches Jake twice in the face and starts grabbing at Jake's belt.] 
Jake shoves him off, and the interrogator waddles away, spinning.] 
The interrogator comes back, fists raised, punches Jake again and goes for the belt.] 
Amir shrugs.] 
CHARLES CROOSHTOOST [pouring chunky milk all over Jake's head] Here we go, and now we're feeling good in the hood! We're feeling good in the hood. 
Sulu Candles throws a bag of candy at Jake, and it hits him in the face.] 
As Charles Crooshtoost is talking, Sulu Candles tries to make Jake flinch with the bag of candy.] 
The interrogator returns.] 
Amir follows Ben and makes a two-person conga line.] 
All of Ben's roommates begin talking over each other. Most of the dialogue is lost in the cacophony.] 
Ben and Amir both type on the computer, and Amir laughs maniacally at what they're writing.] 
A title card reads "4 Hours Later". Jake has toweled the milk off his face.] 
Ben hits a key, and Stony's remix "The Milkman" begins playing. Scalbylausus Jim and Sulu Candles start dancing, and Charles Crooshtoost mouths along to the words.] 
A montage begins, set to "The Milkman", featuring outtakes from all of the episodes in which Ben Schwartz appeared.] 
Jake, Amir, and Ben share a moment out of character.] 
Amir and Ben hug. Ben goes to Jake for a hug, but dips down toward Jake's crotch at the last second.] 
Amir shows up to a restaurant wearing a tacky palm tree shirt and carrying a gold bag full of clubs. Jake is waiting inside.] 
The two producers, later referred to as Lyle and Blanche, show up. Lyle shakes hands with Amir.] 
Lyle laughs.] 
At the table, Jake pitches the show.] 
Amir, Lyle and Blanche all get up and begin running around the table and laughing. Amir chases the other two.] 
They go to sit back down. Lyle smacks Jake in the head.] 
Lyle and Blanche laugh at length.] 
Blanche hands a duffel bag to Amir, who immediately gives it to Jake.] 
Jake opens up the bag. It is full of bills.] 
Amir lights a match and throws it into the bag. Jake puts it out with a wad of bills.] 
Amir throws another match, which Jake puts out.] 
Amir and Blanche both abruptly stand up, looking intensely into each other's eyes. They lean in slowly for a kiss.] 
Amir stands up straight and leaves.] 
Jake and Amir are sitting on a couch.] 
We see that Jake and Amir have set up a TV to watch the audition tapes. Rick Fox has sent one in. Amir points excitedly at the TV and looks at Jake.] 
Clucking noises come from off-screen.] 
The next audition tape is Mike Fink's.] 
Next is Streeter Seidell's tape.] 
Hey guys! Uh, what a fun idea! I'm just gettin' the sides here now... Uh, [adopting a British accent] so this is Streeter Seidell, auditioning for the role, [laughs, drops the accent, then looks at the script] of Eater Pie-Fell. Eater P-- what the fuck, guys! 
Next is Sarah Schneider's tape.] 
Jake grins at Amir.] 
Next is Hoodie Allen's tape.] 
Amir gives a thumbs-up to the projector screen.] 
Next is Doobs's tape.] 
Amir gasps.] 
Oooh, curse you all to hell and back, with your butt dragging on the ground, like... [points at one of the dogs] ...a dog. 
Amir puts his hands together in the air as if strangling somebody. Inexplicably, Doobs begins choking and gasping for air on the tape.] 
Doobs slumps down in his chair, presumably dead.] 
Amir stares at his hands in shock.] 
Amir is getting a call. He dances along to the ringtone.] 
Amir answers.] 
Amir hangs up.] 
On the other end, we see Mickey, played by Ed Helms. Mickey hangs up the phone.] 
Mickey starts crying.] 
Mickey sits silently in his office.] 
Jake and Amir are on a sound stage, sitting in director's chairs. Amir has a megaphone.] 
Amir accidentally sets off the megaphone's siren, but turns it off. Jake snatches it away from him.] 
Amir gestures along as Jake quotes him, raising his arms for emphasis and then pointing at his eye.] 
Amir grunts and squirms for a long time, and shits without farting. He throws the pterodactyl down in frustration.] 
Amir unzips his pants and whips out his relocated big toe.] 
Jake, Amir, and a woman named Angie are in a limo.] 
Amir chuckles.] 
Amir and Angie laugh.] 
Jake flexes his bicep and grins.] 
Angie punches Jake in the face.] 
Angie opens the door of the limo and jumps out. Sounds of car horns and swerving can be heard off-screen.] 
Jake is snorting something off his wrist.] 
Jake nods.] 
Amir motions for Jake to give him the phone and let him do the voice. Jake pushes him away.] 
Jake and Amir are working at their desks. Amir stops typing, pulls out a red "Make America Great Again" baseball cap, and puts it on.] 
Amir pauses.]
